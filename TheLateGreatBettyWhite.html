            <li>Betty was her legal name, not a shortened form of Elizabeth.</li>

            <li>Contrary to popular belief, Betty was the oldest of the four actresses on The Golden Girls.</li>
            <li>On The Merv Griffin Show in 1985, she shared that “if you keep your sense of humor and you try not to keep up with everything that’s young and be ‘hep,’ as they say, but just kind of stay interested in things, I don’t think age becomes a problem.”</li>
            <li>Betty published her first book, Betty White In Person, in 1987. She found time to write several other books over the years, too.</li>
            <li>In 1988, Betty and the other Golden Girls performed for Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mum in the Royal Variety Performance.</li>
            <li>Of her time on The Golden Girls, Betty remarked, “It was just heaven. It was like being with your family every day.”</li>

            <li>She reprised the role on Boston Legal, remarking, “I love playing rotten ladies after all the years of people saying ‘I can’t stand Betty White. She’s so sweet.'”</li>
            <li>On her appearance on Inside the Actors Studio, she shared that “kindness” was her favorite word and “son of a bitch” was her favorite curse word.</li>
            <li>In 2010 at age 88 Betty became the oldest person to host Saturday Night Live thanks to a fan-generated Facebook campaign.</li>
            <li>Betty returned to her roots in 2012 as the host of Betty White’s Off Their Rockers, a show in which older people pranked the younger generation.</li>
            <li>Betty is the only woman to have received an Emmy in all performing comedic categories, and also holds the record for longest span between Emmy nominations for performances—her first was in 1951 and her last was in 2014, a span of over 60 years.</li>
